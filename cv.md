# VITALII MULIAVA

## About myself
Hi, my name is Vitalii. I'm open, honest, motivated person focused on the continuous development of my competences, skills and knowledge. I have a positive approach to new challenges and experiences, and I am also not afraid to learn from my own mistakes. 

My career started as an intern in international bank. Later, I was converted to permanent employee, and I've spent 3 years there doing administrative stuff. I always felt like this was not my cup of tea. At some point, me and my friend started working on some side projects in Python ([**one of them was published publically**](https://github.com/plutus-IV-org/plutus_backtest)). Those projects helped me land a job as a business application developer at a small company.

Looking at my involvement in side projects, the company's vision, and its product, I see the importance of learning front-end development.

## Some code example
Here is a solution for [one of the tasks](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5862f663b4e9d6f12b00003b) on codewars that i wrote in Rust:

```Rust
fn guess_blue(blue_start: u32, red_start: u32, blue_pulled: u32, red_pulled: u32) -> f32 {
    (blue_start as f32 - blue_pulled as f32) / ((blue_start as f32 - blue_pulled as f32) + (red_start as f32 - red_pulled as f32))
}
```
